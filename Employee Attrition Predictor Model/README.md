### Machine Learning Model to predict the attribution of employees within an organization

Attrition in a general term means gradual but a significant decrease in the numbers. So when clubbed with employees it basically indicates the number of staff who have left the organization over a particular period of time.

Using this concept we try to build a predictor model that uses the historical data provided to find the employees that will be leaving the organization in the future.
The aim of doing so is to identify the potential parameters that contribute to the attrition which could then be analyzed by the HR team to make the improvements in those sector to decrease the number of employee attrition and to improve the workforce
