### Run (Using CPU)
======
- Download the .ipynb i.e the Python Notebook and the same on Jupyter, Spyder or any open source web application

### Run (Using GPU/TPU)
======
- Since the CNN model consist of a hugeimage dataset it may not run well on the CPU
- It is advised to make use of the GPU or TPU provided by Kaggle or Google Colab for faster processing

### Project Structure
- CNN (Dog vs Cat) Classifier.ipynb -The python notebook containg the CNN model 
- test (folder)  - Contains the images that has to be used to the final testing purpose. This images does not contain the labels but only a number 
- train (folder) - Contains ~25000 images of dogs and cats split equally for training the CNN model
- CNN_Model - Contains the detailed documentation of the CNN model implemented along with the libraries and theoretical concepts
