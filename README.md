## Employee Attrition Predictor

### Machine Learning Model to predict the attribution of employees within an organization

#### Attrition in a general term means gradual but a significant decrease in the numbers. So when clubbed with employees it basically indicates the number of staff who have left the organization over a particular period of time.

#### Using this concept we try to build a predictor model that uses the historical data provided to find the employees that will be leaving the organiation in the future.
